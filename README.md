# AoTTG-2-Tester-Practice-Repo

This repo is meant as a sandbox for AoTTG 2 testers to toy with.  Nothing here is actually important, so feel free to experiment with it--even if you accidentally break something, it won't cause problems.

All testers should get used to using Issues in this repo.  This video is a good overview of how they work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJlYiMp8FuY

After you've watched that video, click on the Issues tab up above (Just under "SlowDeepExhalation", to the right of "<> Code"), and then click on Labels, and find "Good Bug Report!" in the list.  Click on it, and it'll show you a list of fake bug reports written by other testers, following the basic format for what a bug report should look like.  Currently, they should all follow this format:

**Bug:** What the bug is.

**How to Reproduce:** How you can make the bug happen.

**Expected Behavior:** What *should* happen instead of the bug.

**Additional Notes:** Anything else that should be mentioned about the bug.

Read one or a few of them, and then click the green "New Issue" in the upper right, and write up a bug report yourself, following the same format.  The bug doesn't have to actually exist, or be in AoTTG--you can describe a bug that exists in *any* game, or make something up about purple unicorns, as long as it's clear, understandable, and follows the correct format.  Tell Antigasp (SlowDeepExhalation) that you created the bug, and he'll tell you if it should be changed or improved.  If not, he'll give it the "Good Bug Report!" label, and you can pat yourself on the back.

After you've written up the report, look through the other reports, and try to find one that doesn't say it's been confirmed on your OS (Windows or Mac).  Go ahead and add a "CONFIRMED on OS" label to it, choosing whichever OS you use.  Don't add those tags to your own report though--every bug should be confirmed by somebody *other* than the person who first mentioned it.  If there aren't any bugs that haven't been confirmed on your system, feel free to remove the tags and readd them yourself.  You shouldn't do that in the AoTTG 2 project's page, but it's fine here.


The testing team is very young, so we'll probably improve our system over time.  Lithrun and the other developers working on AoTTG 2 will give us feedback about how we can be more helpful.  As changes are made, this page will be updated, and they'll be talked about in the Discord channel.
